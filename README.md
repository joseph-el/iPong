## Overview
iPong is a multiplayer online Pong game where players compete in various challenges. Developed collaboratively by [Youssef Elidrissi](https://github.com/joseph-el), [Abderrahman ELKHALIL](https://github.com/ELkhalil), and [Mouad Mounaji](https://github.com/Mmounaji176), iPong boasts an engaging user interface and experience. The front-end was crafted using React, TypeScript, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, enhanced by design tools such as Figma and Adobe Photoshop. On the back end, we deployed a robust infrastructure leveraging ORM Prisma, PostgreSQL, Realtime socket.io, and NestJS for seamless performance and scalability.
